Code 1: Finds the total resistance for resistors in parallel by adding the reciprical of each resistor value
Code 2: Splits the supply voltage across resistors.
Code 3: Checks if a temperature is normal, too low, or too high. 

The lab implemented common concepts we learned in engineeringand forced us to apply that knowledge in python 

Why did the capacitor blow up?
Because it couldn't handle the charge !
